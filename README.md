## About

*Dependente* is a small command-line program for extracting
dependencies from Python project files (`pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg`)
and converting them into `requirements.txt`-type files for use with
`pip` and `conda`.

The main reason to do so is to control and customize the testing
environment on continuous integration (CI) while avoiding repeating
the list of dependencies in multiple places.

## Installing

*Dependente* is available from PyPI:

```
python -m pip install dependente
```

and conda-forge:

```
conda install dependente -c conda-forge
```

## Using

Parse the install (run-time) dependencies from `setup.cfg`:

```
$ dependente > requirements.txt
ðŸš€ Extracting dependencies: install
ðŸ”Ž Parsing setup.cfg
   - 3 dependencies found
ðŸ–¨  Printing 3 dependencies to the standard output stream
ðŸ¥³ Done! ðŸ¥³

$ cat requirements.txt
# Install (run-time) dependencies from setup.cfg
click>=8.0.0,<9.0.0
rich>=9.6.0,<11.0.0
tomli>=1.1.0,<3.0.0
```

Pin the dependencies to their oldest supported version (useful for testing
in CI):

```
$ dependente --oldest > requirements-oldest.txt
ðŸš€ Extracting dependencies: install
ðŸ”Ž Parsing setup.cfg
   - 3 dependencies found
ðŸ•°  Pinning dependencies to their oldest versions
ðŸ–¨  Printing 3 dependencies to the standard output stream
ðŸ¥³ Done! ðŸ¥³

$ cat requirements-oldest.txt
# Install (run-time) dependencies from setup.cfg
click==8.0.0
rich==9.6.0
tomli==1.1.0
```

Read build dependencies from `pyproject.toml`:

```
$ dependente --source build > requirements-build.txt
ðŸš€ Extracting dependencies: build
ðŸ”Ž Parsing pyproject.toml
   - 3 dependencies found
ðŸ–¨  Printing 3 dependencies to the standard output stream
ðŸ¥³ Done! ðŸ¥³

$ cat requirements-build.txt
# Build dependencies from pyproject.toml
setuptools>=45
setuptools_scm[toml]>=6.2
wheel
```

```
$ dependente --help
Usage: dependente [OPTIONS]

  Dependente: Inspect Python package dependencies

  Reads from the configuration files in the current directory and outputs to
  stdout a list of dependencies into a format accepted by pip.

  Supported formats:

  * pyproject.toml (only build-system > requires)

  * setup.cfg (install_requires and options.extras_require)

Options:
  -s, --source TEXT            Which sources of dependency information to
                               extract. Can be any combination of
                               'install,extras,build'.  [default: install]
  -o, --oldest                 If enabled, will pin dependencies to the oldest
                               accepted version.  [default: False]
  -v, --verbose / -q, --quiet  Print information during execution / Don't
                               print  [default: verbose]
  --version                    Show the version and exit.
  -h, --help                   Show this message and exit.
```

### Limitations

The current implementation is a proof-of-concept and has some limitations:

* Input files must be in the current working directory.
* Reads all extra dependencies simultaneously (can't separate between different
  `option.extras_requires` fields).
* Only supports reading from `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml` (build
  dependencies only).

Of course, all of these could be addressed if there is enough interest.
Issues and PRs are welcome!
